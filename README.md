# proposal 4 SOUTH.dao

gm frens,

i'm off the grid on a greyhound heading south writing this on a petty theft droid connected to carlos' hotspot, an illegal alien from guatemala. a southern man can survive wif no fiat, no cellular device, and no wallet or id. welcome to this brave new world called web3.

## foundation

foundational to my proposal for the dao i previously mentioned to a few of u acoustic pseudonymous individuals are the following points:

- counter cultural web3 movement best embodied by southern not punk ethos
- tap into historical context & music scene to onboard normies
- create lifestyle brand
- create custom web apps & droid web2 apps
- create custom products
- expand dao through digital media & distribution growth hacks
- define brand voice but embrace individuality & fam/fren inclusive community
- token gate community & sub communities through hundreds of token collections on multiple blockchains
- expand geo region outside south through transition to web3 rebel ethos fighting against establishment & for local community rights
